//Madlibs
/*
Madlibs is a simple game wher you create a story template with "blanks" for
words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them
into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

Create a simple madlib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and
an adjective, and injects them into a story that you create.
